            <h2>Project Website</h2>
            <p><b>Team Members: </b>Jonah Sussman, Christian Holcombe, Andy Hansen, and Sam Perry</p>
            <p>The goal of the project is to create an app that makes water data easily manipulated and more visually appealing to study and display. Many existing apps focus on weather events and displaying daily data, but our app will focus on trend visualization and be used mainly for research and educational purposes. This data will be sourced from both the client, Alabama Water Institute, and from publicly available APIs.</p>
            <p>This project will be considered a success if we can display water data in a way that is easy to understand, coherent, and teaches the users more about the environment. The interface for the app will be a map with various overlays and data points, and allow users to select which data they would like to view. The app will focus on the state of Alabama to begin, and, if the project timeline allows, expand to the entire continental US.</p>

            <h3><b>Project Goals</b></h3>
            <p>The main goal of our project is to provide a user-friendly web application that can be used to visualize trends and data uploaded to the server.</p>
            <p>
                <b>More Specific Goals Include:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Setting up a web server to host our application.</li>
                <li>Creating a dynamic front end to request data.</li>
                <li>Reading data from multiple services to conglomerate water data.</li>
                <li>Using Geoserver to format and hold data layers.</li>
                <li>Tutorial for uploading data layers to Geoserver.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3><b>Approach</b></h3>
            <h4><b>Tools</b></h4>
            <p><i><b>floviz</b></i> is a <b>web-hosted React project</b>. We use <b>Geoserver</b> to handle the layering and storage of data for the front end to pull and display. Additionally, we use <b>Github</b> to upload code and communicate changes to the codebase. The server currently hosting the application is a <b>personal server</b> and will be transitioned to a server maintained by the Alabama Water Institute. For data fetching and scraping, we have used <b>Python</b> and a library, <b>Climata</b>, which scrapes data from specified Alabama streams and creates dynamic visuals for educational purposes.</p>
            <h4><b>User-Experience</b></h4>
            <p>The user will be presented with a blank map with several different sidebar sections. To the left, the user will be able to select from layers of data currently in Geoserver to be displayed over the map. To the right, there is a begin data and end date which will allow the user to specifiy the dates of the data they want to select. There is also a set of buttons that allow the user to select the interval of time to fetch and load the data as well as select the playback speed of the video returned. Finally, the user can fetch and load data using the fetch data button as well as set the bounding box for the data to be displayed. There also exists buttons at the bottom which have information about our application, displays our github repository, and a link to contact us via email.</p>
