        <h1>The Water App - Project Site</h1>
        <p><b>Team Members: </b>Jonah Sussman, Christian Holcombe, Andy Hansen, and Sam Perry</p>
        <p>Although there exists copious amounts of data covering every minute detail about the water, an easily readable and maneuverable app to visualize, study, and learn about this water data does not exist. The goal of The Water App is to provide a coherent application that fills our client's needs, bringing important data about water to the public.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The main goal of our project is to provide a user-friendly web application that highlights water-related metrics provided to us by the Alabama Water Institute and National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>
          <b>More Specific Goals Include:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Setting up a web server to host our application.</li>
            <li>Creating a dynamic map interface.</li>
            <li>Reading data from multiple services to conglomerate water data.</li>
            <li>Creating clean and informative overlays for the data.</li>
          </ol>
          <b>Possible Goals:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Creating user authentication for web app.</li>
            <li>Setting up database to store user information.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>The Water App is a <b>REACT web-hosted project</b>. It is currently running on <b>personal servers (DigitalOcean)</b> for development and testing, but will be moved later to find a more permanent solution. It uses the <b>Geoapify API</b> for the creation of the dynamic map that will display our data. <b>Leaflet</b> is a <b>JavaScript</b> open-source library that allows simple and readable overlays to be created to visualize our data. The data will come from the <b>Alabama Water Institute</b> and the <b>National Weather Service</b>. </p>
        <h3>User-Experience</h3>
        <p>The app is aiming to be an app that all users regardless of knowledge level. When a user first visits our website, they will be shown a plain map of the United States, focused on Alabama. There will be several overlay options that the user can click on and show the water data they want on the map. There will be a location search bar for different US cities, states, and coordinates, but the user can also drag the map around to visit different locations. In the future, the user may be able to log in and be shown their previous search instead of a plain map. The user may be able to click on specific points in the data and get in depth information about the specific water metric.</p>
